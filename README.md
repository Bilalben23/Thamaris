# Restaurant Website

## Overview
The **Restaurant Website** project is a clean, responsive website built using HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript. It introduces the restaurant with a brief description, displays the menu items in interactive carousels, and features a contact form for users to make table reservations. The project focuses on delivering a user-friendly interface that showcases the restaurantâ€™s offerings and provides an easy way for customers to get in touch.

## Features

- **Menu Display in Carousels**: The restaurant's menu is presented in interactive carousels for easy navigation. Users can scroll through different categories (e.g., appetizers, main courses, desserts) with smooth transitions.
- **Contact Form for Reservations**: A simple, functional contact form that allows users to reserve a table by providing their name, email, phone number, and preferred reservation time.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a great experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
